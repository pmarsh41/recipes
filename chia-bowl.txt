Chia Breakfast Bowl
1-3 tablespoons chia seeds
2/3 cup almond-coconut milk (or other nut milk)

pinch of good salt

coconut nectar, maple syrup, stevia, or honey, to taste

top with: toasted coconut flakes, seasonal fruit (I used passion fruit & blackberries), something with a bit of crunch (I used pumpkin seeds) - walnuts, sunflower seeds, granola, etc. A bit of bee pollen if you use it (and aren't allergic).

Combine the chia seeds with the almond milk and stir well. Allow to sit for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the chia seeds completely bloom and soften. You can also do this step a night ahead, but I like the flavor better when the chia isn't allowed to sit for that long. Just before serving, sweeten to taste with preferred sweetener, and then top with toasted coconut flakes, crushed seasonal fruit, and anything else you like.

Makes one bowl. Double or triple the recipe based on the number of people you are serving.
